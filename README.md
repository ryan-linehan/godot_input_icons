# godot_input_icons

A godot plugin for displaying keyboard and controller icons

## Current

- InputIconTextureRect for displaying user registered actions as images
- Support for keyboard modifiers

## Planned

- Example to show how to listen to input swap (perhaps use godot_input_helper for this?)
- Input remapper demo project + UI example
- C# nuget package wrapper (if needed)

## Future

- TextureButton support for input icons (Is this useful?)
- Input combo texture rect (allows for chaining multiple actions into a single texture rect)
- InputLabel for displaying user registered actions as labels
- NathanHoad input_helper module for remapping support + reacting to device changes
- Translations module for keyboard icons for different languages
- Add texture button support?
- A input map viewer of the current setup of input icons over a controller
    / a keyboard with only the mapped keys put in place
- Options to use a font based system instead of images
